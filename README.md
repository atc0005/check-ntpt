## Project home

See [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/atc0005/ntpt) for the latest

## Requirements

- Go 1.13+ (for building)
- GCC
  - if building with custom options (as the provided `Makefile` does)
- `make`
  - if using the provided `Makefile`

   - if using `go build`: look in `/tmp/ntpt/`

## Configuration

### Command-line arguments

- Flags marked as **`required`** must be set via CLI flag *or* within a
  TOML-formatted configuration file.
- Flags *not* marked as required are for settings where a useful default is
  already defined.

| Flag          | Required | Default        | Repeat | Possible                                              | Description                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `h`, `help`   | No       | `false`        | No     | `h`, `help`                                           | Show Help text along with the list of supported flags. |
| `s`, `server` | **Yes**  | *empty string* | **No** | *one valid IP Address or fully-qualified server name* | NTP server to submit query against.                    |
